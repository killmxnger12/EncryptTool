# Encryption tool
There needs to be 3 text files for the code to run successfully.
They are input.txt, encrypted.txt, output.txt; and their use is pretty simple.
Input.txt is used for the user to input text they wish to encrypt. When the program is ran for an encryption purpose it will encrypt the text in that file and store the encrypted values to encrypted.txt. If the user wishes to decrypt some values, user needs to fill the encrypted text file with the values he wishes to encrypt. When the program runs successfully the decrypted values will be in the output.txt file.
